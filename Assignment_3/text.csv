<p>,Albert Einstein has rightly said, “Try not to become a man of success but a man of value.” In line with this theme, PEC organized a three day Training Workshop for Faculty Mentors on Induction Programme for New Students that was commenced today in the auditorium of the University. It is being conducted by National Project Implementation Unit (NPIU), MHRD under TEQIP-III project from 22nd to 24th September 2017.
<p>,The workshop was inaugurated by Dr. Uma Batra, Deputy Director, PEC. Prof. Anil Kumar Tripathi, Professor and Dean, IIT, Varanasi, Dr. Jagmeet Bawa, Coordinator and Mr. Jatinder Narula, Incharge, International Resource Centre for Universal Human Values & Ethics, PTU were the keynote speakers who shared their valuable knowledge and experiences with all the participants.
